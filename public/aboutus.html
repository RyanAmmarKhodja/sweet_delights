                <h1 class="regular">Our history</h1>
                <h5 class="silk regular pt-2">Sweet Delights began as a small family-owned bakery with a big dream: to
                    bring the joy of home-baked
                    goodness to our community. Founded in 2005 by Jane and John Doe, our bakery started in a tiny
                    kitchen with just a few cherished family recipes. Over the years, our dedication to quality and love
                    for baking have helped us grow into the beloved local bakery we are today.
                    <br><br>
                    Our journey has been filled with hard work, creativity, and a lot of flour. We've expanded our menu
                    to include a wide variety of baked goods, from classic favorites to innovative new creations, all
                    while staying true to our roots. Every item we bake is crafted with love, care, and a commitment to
                    excellence, just as it was on day one.
